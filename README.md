# comparebuilds

WoW talent build comparison tool — deployed as a static site behind your own domain.

## Deployment

### 1. Build the frontend

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces a `dist/` folder containing the static site.

### 2. Upload files to the server

Upload the **contents** of `dist/` to the web root folder (the folder that your domain points to). Upload `api/share.php` into an `api/` subfolder inside that same web root.

Expected layout on the server:

```
/home/username/
├── config.php          ← credentials file, above the web root
└── www/                ← web root (your domain → this folder)
    ├── index.html
    ├── assets/
    ├── sw.js
    └── api/
        └── share.php
```

### 3. Create config.php above the web root

Copy `api/config.php.example` to `/home/username/config.php` (one level above the web root) and fill in your MariaDB credentials:

```php
<?php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
define('DB_USER', 'your_db_user');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_db_password');
```

This location keeps the credentials inaccessible to the public even if PHP processing were to fail.

### 4. Create the database table

`share.php` runs `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on every request, so the table is created automatically on first use. You can also create it manually via your MariaDB/MySQL client (phpMyAdmin, CLI, or your host's database tool):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comparebuilds_shares (
    id         CHAR(6)    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    data       MEDIUMTEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_created (created_at)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

### 5. Point the domain

In your hosting control panel, point your domain to the web root folder you uploaded to. No `.htaccess` rewrite rules are needed — the app uses hash-based routing and all routes are served by `index.html`.

## Share link API

`api/share.php` handles short links for sharing builds:

| Method | Parameters | Response |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `POST` | JSON body `{ classId, specId, builds: ["…","…"] }` — 2–5 build strings, each ≤ 2000 chars | `{ id }` — 6-char alphanumeric |
| `GET`  | `?id=xxxxxx` | Stored JSON payload |

Rows older than 90 days are deleted on each `POST` request.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The PHP API is not available in the local dev server. Sharing links will 404 locally — test that feature on the deployed site.

## Talent data

The app reads only the normalised JSON in `src/data/` — it never talks to any
external data source at runtime. That normalised schema is the contract; how the
data is produced (the ingest script, a hand edit, or a different source) is an
implementation detail behind it.

### Build-string format

`src/lib/buildString.js` parses/encodes the game's native talent loadout string
(the same one the in-game UI and any calculator export). The wire format is fixed
by the game; only the *node list* depends on the data. Importing and sharing
builds is not tied to any particular data provider.

### Tests

```bash
npm test            # run all suites once (Vitest)
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
npm run coverage    # run with a coverage report (text + html in coverage/)
```

Runs three suites:

- **`treeLogic.test.js`** — prerequisite/gate cascade logic.
- **`buildString.test.js`** — per-class encode→decode round-trips, so a data
  change that would silently misparse build strings fails here instead.
- **`dataIntegrity.test.js`** — validates every class file against the schema
  (`validateClassData.js`) and checks each class's build-string **wire-layout
  snapshot** (`wireLayout.snapshot.json`).

### Editing or repopulating the data

You can hand-edit `src/data/*.json` or regenerate it from any source. After any
change, run `npm test`:

- A **schema** failure means the file is structurally wrong (missing fields, bad
  node types, dangling connections, etc.) — fix it before shipping.
- A **wire-layout snapshot** failure means your change shifted build-string bit
  positions, so **every existing build string and share link for that class will
  now parse differently**. If that is intentional (e.g. a new game patch added
  nodes), regenerate the snapshot deliberately:

  ```bash
  UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 npm test
  ```

`scripts/ingestTalentData.js` (the current Icy Veins importer) runs the same
validation on every class and refreshes the snapshot automatically; it aborts
without updating the snapshot if any class fails validation. To target a
different source, rewrite its normaliser to emit the same schema — the validator
and round-trip tests will tell you when the output is correct.
