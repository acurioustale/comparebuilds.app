# comparebuilds

WoW talent build comparison tool — deployed at comparebuilds.app.

## Deployment

### Automated deploys

Pushing to `main` deploys automatically. The
[`deploy` workflow](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) runs on every push to `main`
(and can be triggered manually from the Actions tab), builds the site, and runs
`deploy.sh`. `deploy.sh` stages the built `dist/` together with the PHP API
(`api/share.php`, `api/og.php`, `api/fonts/`) into one tree and mirrors it with a
single `rsync -avz --delete` to the web root:

```
web4186@http2.core-networks.de:html/comparebuilds.app/
```

Staging the two sources into one tree is what makes `--delete` safe: `dist/` has
no `api/`, so deleting against `dist/` alone would wipe the live API folder.
`config.php` (below) lives one level above the web root and is never touched.

CI authenticates with a dedicated SSH deploy key, stored as the repository
secrets `DEPLOY_SSH_KEY` and `DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS`. The key is harmless if leaked:
on the host it's pinned to a forced command
(`~web4186/bin/rsync-jail-comparebuilds.sh`, wired up in that account's
`authorized_keys`) that allows only an rsync *push* into `html/comparebuilds.app/`
— no shell, no pull, and no path traversal outside that directory. This is why
the deploy target in `deploy.sh` must keep its trailing slash; the jail matches
on that exact prefix.

To deploy by hand instead (uses your own SSH access), run:

```bash
./deploy.sh            # live
./deploy.sh --dry-run  # preview what would change
```

### First-time server setup

The steps below prepare the host that the automated deploy relies on but does
not perform — the credentials file, database, and domain. Steps 1 and 2 also
document the build output and on-server file layout, which `deploy.sh` now
handles for you.

### 1. Build the frontend

```bash
npm run build
```

This produces a `dist/` folder containing the static site. It also prerenders a
crawlable landing page per class+spec (`dist/<class>/<spec>/index.html`, e.g.
`/death-knight/blood/`) with its own title/description/Open Graph tags and a
static summary, plus `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`. These are plain files inside
`dist/`, so they ship with the normal upload — no extra step. The live app still
uses hash routing; the spec pages exist so search engines and link unfurls have
real content, and opening one boots the calculator on that spec.

### 2. Upload files to the server

Upload the **contents** of `dist/` to the web root folder (the folder that comparebuilds.app points to). Upload `api/share.php`, `api/og.php`, and the `api/fonts/` folder into an `api/` subfolder inside that same web root.

`og.php` renders the Open Graph preview image for shared links and needs PHP's **GD** extension with FreeType (for text). It ships its own bold TTF in `api/fonts/`, so no system fonts are required; set `OG_FONT_PATH` in `config.php` only to override it. It emits whichever image format the host's GD supports (PNG → JPEG → GIF → WebP), so it works even on GD builds without PNG. Make sure the `api/fonts/` folder is uploaded alongside `og.php`. Pretty share URLs (`/s/<id>`) rely on `mod_rewrite` (configured in the shipped `.htaccess`).

Expected layout on the server:

```
/home/username/
├── config.php          ← credentials file, above the web root
└── www/                ← web root (comparebuilds.app → this folder)
    ├── index.html
    ├── .htaccess        ← shipped from dist/ (mod_rewrite for /s/<id>, security headers)
    ├── assets/
    ├── sw.js
    └── api/
        ├── share.php
        ├── og.php
        └── fonts/
            └── DejaVuSans-Bold.ttf
```

### 3. Create config.php above the web root

Copy `api/config.php.example` to `/home/username/config.php` (one level above the web root) and fill in your MariaDB credentials:

```php
<?php
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
define('DB_NAME', 'your_database_name');
define('DB_USER', 'your_db_user');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_db_password');
```

This location keeps the credentials inaccessible to the public even if PHP processing were to fail.

### 4. Create the database table

`share.php` runs `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` on every request, so the table is created automatically on first use. You can also create it manually via your MariaDB/MySQL client (phpMyAdmin, CLI, or your host's database tool):

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS comparebuilds_shares (
    id         CHAR(6)    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    data       MEDIUMTEXT NOT NULL,
    ip_hash    CHAR(64)   NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_created (created_at),
    INDEX idx_ip_created (ip_hash, created_at)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```

`ip_hash` stores a salted SHA-256 of the creator's IP, used only for per-IP rate
limiting (20 shares/hour by default).

### 5. Point the domain

In your hosting control panel, point the `comparebuilds.app` domain to the web root folder you uploaded to. The SPA itself uses hash-based routing, so its own routes are all served by `index.html` with no rewrite. The shipped `.htaccess` does add one `mod_rewrite` rule — it maps the pretty share URLs (`/s/<id>`) to `api/share.php` so links unfurl with a preview — along with the site's security headers. It needs `mod_rewrite` and `mod_headers`; both rules are wrapped in `<IfModule>` guards, so the site still works (minus pretty share links / headers) on a host where they're unavailable.

## Share link API

`api/share.php` handles short links for sharing builds:

| Method | Parameters | Response |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `POST` | JSON body `{ classId, specId, builds: ["…","…"] }` — 2–5 build strings, each ≤ 2000 chars. Optional: `labels` (array parallel to `builds`, each ≤ 40 chars — the per-slot names) and `className`/`specName` (≤ 64 chars, used by the OG image). | `{ id }` — 6-char alphanumeric |
| `GET`  | `?id=xxxxxx` | Stored JSON payload (includes `labels`/`className`/`specName` when they were sent) |

Rows older than 90 days are deleted on each `POST` request.

### Security & limits

`share.php` is hardened for public exposure:

- **Per-IP rate limit** — 20 creates per IP per hour (`429` past that), tracked via a
  salted IP hash; set `SHARE_IP_SALT` in `config.php` to a random secret. Behind a
  trusted reverse proxy/CDN, also set `TRUST_PROXY` so the limit keys on the real
  client (the first `X-Forwarded-For` hop) instead of the proxy address.
- **Body cap** — requests over 16 KB are rejected (`413`) before parsing; JSON depth is capped.
- **Strict validation** — `classId`/`specId` must be positive integers, 2–5 builds, each a
  base64 build string ≤ 2000 chars; only the validated fields are stored (never the raw body).
- **Same-origin only** — no CORS headers are sent, so other sites can't call the API from a browser.
- **No error leakage** — DB/runtime errors return a generic JSON message; details are never exposed.
- All queries use prepared statements; IDs use a CSPRNG (`random_int`).

## Sharing

Two ways to share builds:

- **Copy link** — POSTs the builds to `api/share.php`, which returns a 6-char id; the
  link is `…/#xxxxxx` (or `…/s/xxxxxx`). Persistent, short, backed by the DB.
- **Copy instant link** — encodes the builds straight into the URL hash
  (`…/#b=<token>`, base64url of the build strings). No server call, no rate limit,
  works offline; the trade-off is a long URL. Opening either kind loads the builds
  on page load (a share in the URL takes precedence over locally saved state).

## Local persistence

Your work is autosaved to the browser's `localStorage` (key `comparebuilds-state`),
so a page reload keeps any builds you've added and the in-progress interactive
selection. This is separate from the share API: it stays on your device, hits no
server, and isn't rate-limited. Only the small serialisable state is saved (the
build strings, spec/class, and interactive selection); the decoded trees are
rebuilt on load.

A share id in the URL (`…/#xxxxxx`) takes precedence — opening a shared link loads
that build instead of your saved local state. One caveat: a build string typed
into a slot but not yet submitted isn't saved, since it's only transient input.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The PHP API is not available in the local dev server. Sharing links will 404 locally — test that feature on the deployed site.

## Talent data

The app reads only the normalised JSON in `src/data/` — it never talks to any
external data source at runtime. That normalised schema is the contract; how the
data is produced (the ingest script, a hand edit, or a different source) is an
implementation detail behind it.

### Build-string format

`src/lib/buildString.js` parses/encodes the game's native talent loadout string
(the same one the in-game UI and any calculator export). The wire format is fixed
by the game; only the *node list* depends on the data. Importing and sharing
builds is not tied to any particular data provider.

### Tests

```bash
npm run lint        # ESLint (flat config) — also enforced in CI
npm test            # run all suites once (Vitest)
npm run test:watch  # watch mode
npm run coverage    # run with a coverage report (text + html in coverage/)
```

The suite spans the logic layer and the components (Vitest, several hundred tests
across a dozen-plus files in `src/`). The ones that specifically guard data
correctness — the most important to understand before editing `src/data/`:

- **`treeLogic.test.js`** — prerequisite/gate cascade logic.
- **`buildString.test.js`** — per-class encode→decode round-trips, so a data
  change that would silently misparse build strings fails here instead.
- **`buildFixtures.test.js`** — decodes real build strings exported from the
  in-game UI, confirming our node IDs/ordering/budgets match what the game emits.
- **`dataIntegrity.test.js`** — validates every class file against the schema
  (`validateClassData.js`) and checks each class's build-string **wire-layout
  snapshot** (`wireLayout.snapshot.json`).

The rest cover the store, the diff/heatmap logic, the HTML sanitiser, and the
React components.

### Editing or repopulating the data

You can hand-edit `src/data/*.json` or regenerate it from any source. After any
change, run `npm test`:

- A **schema** failure means the file is structurally wrong (missing fields, bad
  node types, dangling connections, etc.) — fix it before shipping.
- A **wire-layout snapshot** failure means your change shifted build-string bit
  positions, so **every existing build string and share link for that class will
  now parse differently**. If that is intentional (e.g. a new game patch added
  nodes), regenerate the snapshot deliberately:

  ```bash
  UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 npm test
  ```

`scripts/ingestTalentData.js` (the current Icy Veins importer) runs the same
validation on every class and refreshes the snapshot automatically; it aborts
without updating the snapshot if any class fails validation. To target a
different source, rewrite its normaliser to emit the same schema — the validator
and round-trip tests will tell you when the output is correct.
