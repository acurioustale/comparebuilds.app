// registered a worker that cached wow.zamimg.com icons; icons are now served
// first-party from /talent-icons, so the worker is gone. Returning visitors are still
// controlled by the old worker (which also cached opaque, sometimes-blocked
// responses for days) until it's unregistered, so do that and purge its caches.
// The worker only intercepted zamimg, never the app shell, so this code always
// runs on the next visit. Safe to remove once the install base has turned over.
