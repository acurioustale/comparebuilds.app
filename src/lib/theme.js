 * lib/ coverage gate.
 *
 * The model: a three-way mode — "auto" (follow the OS), "light", "dark" —
 * persisted under THEME_STORAGE_KEY. "auto" is the default when nothing valid is
 * stored. The *resolved* theme (what the DOM actually paints) is always light or
 * dark; "auto" resolves through the OS `prefers-color-scheme`.
