// served first-party — third-party icon requests are blocked by common content
// blockers and browser tracking protection, which left users with broken icons.
// The path is /talent-icons (not /icons) because
// Apache reserves /icons for mod_autoindex's directory-listing graphics, and
// that server-level alias would shadow our files. Falls back to a transparent
// 1x1 gif when the icon name is missing so a bad data row can't crash a render.
