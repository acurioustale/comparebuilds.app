# rsync-jail-comparebuilds.sh — forced command confining the comparebuilds CI
# deploy key.
#
# Installed on the deploy host at ~/bin/rsync-jail-comparebuilds.sh and pinned to
# the deploy key in that account's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:
#
#   command="~/bin/rsync-jail-comparebuilds.sh",no-pty,no-agent-forwarding,no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding ssh-... <deploy key>
#
# This file is the REVIEWED SOURCE; the copy on the server is what runs. The
# jailed key can only rsync into the web root — it cannot write ~/bin — so the
# deploy can neither install nor verify this script. After changing it here, an
# admin with full account access must copy it into place manually:
#
#   scp ops/rsync-jail-comparebuilds.sh web4186@http2.core-networks.de:bin/
#
# It allow-lists EXACTLY the SSH commands deploy.sh issues. If you add a new
# `ssh "$REMOTE" "..."` call to deploy.sh, add a matching case here and reinstall,
# or the deploy fails with "rsync-jail: only rsync push allowed". Permits exactly:
#   1. an rsync --server push (the deploy), and
#   2. the post-deploy schema migration.
# Everything else is rejected.
