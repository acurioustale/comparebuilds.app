# Deploy comparebuilds.app to the web host via rsync over ssh.
# Usage: ./deploy.sh [--dry-run]   (extra args pass through to rsync)
#
# The served tree comes from two places, so we stage them into one directory
# and mirror that with a single --delete pass:
#   - dist/                         the built static site (run `npm run build` first)
#   - api/{share.php,og.php,fonts}  the PHP share API + Open Graph image renderer
#
# Staging keeps --delete from wiping the live api/ folder (which is not part of
# dist/). config.php (the DB credentials) lives one level ABOVE the web root and
# is left untouched. The CI key is confined to TARGET server-side by a forced-
# command rsync jail (~/bin/rsync-jail-comparebuilds.sh), so it cannot write
# anywhere else in the shared account; the jail expects this home-relative path.
